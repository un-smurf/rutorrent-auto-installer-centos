ruTorrent Auto Installer Script for CentOS

This is forked from: https://github.com/etiennerached/rutorrent-auto-installer-centos
I have updated versions and edited Default settings to my requirements 

OLD README
This auto installer was initially found in here:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/autodl-irssi/files/autodl-setup/download

However it's no longer updated by it's original author, and most of the SVNs were outdated which broke the installation.
So I decided to fix the urls and add it in here.

How to run and install instructions:
